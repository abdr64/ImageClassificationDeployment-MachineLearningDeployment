# Image Classification Model Deployment - Submission 03
In submission section, the student must build a machine learning model for image classification and meet the submission criteria.

The criteria's are:

 - Any image dataset with a minimum of **1000 samples**
 - Split the dataset into **80% train set** and **20% test set**
 - A model must be built in **Sequential**
 - Must use **Conv2D Maxpooling Layer**
 - Accuracy on training and validation set is at least above **80%**
 - Must use **Callback**
 - Visualize the accuracy and loss of the model with a **plot** chart
 - Write a code that saves the model in **TF-Lite** format

Reviewers will give ratings by scaling from 1 - 5 based on the code when the task has met the criteria.

The details of the ratings are: 

 1. Indicated of plagiarism
 2. The code needs to be fixed
 3. Only to follow the modules provided in the course
 4. Using a dataset with **2000 samples** and a minimum of **three classes**. Also the accuracy of training and validation sets are at least **85%**
 5. Using a dataset with **10000 samples**. The image's resolutions are not in uniform size. As well as the accuracy of the training and validation sets are above **92%**

 The code in this repository is a result of my deployment model work. This is the final submission to complete the course from Dicoding
